This project is a simple, elegant contact form implemented using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features an Apple-inspired design with smooth animations and a responsive layout.

## Live Demo

You can view the live version of the website here: [Contact Form Vanilla JS](https://contact-form-vanilla.vercel.app)

## Features

- Clean, minimalist design inspired by Apple's aesthetic
- Responsive layout that works well on both desktop and mobile devices
- Smooth animations for form submission and success message display
- Simple validation for required fields
- Easily customizable styles and behavior

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)

## Project Structure

The project consists of three main files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the contact form
- `styles.css`: The CSS file with all the styles for the form and animations
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file handling form submission and animations

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the contact form.
3. To make changes, edit the HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files as needed.
4. To use this form in a live environment, you'll need to add server-side code to handle the form submission.

## Customization

You can easily customize the form by modifying the following:

- Colors: Edit the color values in the `styles.css` file.
- Form fields: Add or remove fields in the `index.html` file and update the corresponding styles.
- Animations: Adjust the animation properties in both `styles.css` and `script.js`.

## Future Improvements

- Add more robust form validation
- Implement actual form submission to a server
- Enhance accessibility with ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation
- Add support for dark mode
